## Current Focus
- Exploring and learning everything  
- Building full-stack applications with the MERN stack  
- Experimenting  

## Beyond Code
When I'm not coding, you'll find me:  
- Playing the oud  
- Watching literally everything about cars (shoutout to Mat Armstrong and Cars By Maged)  
- Listening to music and making too many playlists that I probably won’t listen to
