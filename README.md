- 👋 Hey, I'm Ali Yousef! I study Media Engineering and Technology at GUC and I'm really into MLE; We're living closer to a sci-fi movie than we realize xD

- 🎓 I'm working toward my B.Sc. in Media Engineering and Technology (CSE). Graduated top of my grade from Saint Fatima Language School.

- 🌟 When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing the oud, geeking out over cars, working on stained glass projects, or just listening to music.

- 🚀 Currently just absorbing as much as possible while I work out what I want to commit to long-term.
